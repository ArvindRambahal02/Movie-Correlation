## About the Project
- Analyzed Movie Industry data to identify correlations using Python
- Data Preprocessing:
  - Removed missing values (NaN) by dropping corresponding rows.
  - Converted data types: Floats to integers, and one column to strings.
  - Corrected year column by extracting year from release dates and storing in a new column.

- Data Visualization:
  - Utilized Seaborn to generate linear regression plots, demonstrating the impact of movie budget on gross earnings.
  - Created a correlation matrix heatmap using Seaborn and Matplotlib, visualizing the correlations between different variables.
